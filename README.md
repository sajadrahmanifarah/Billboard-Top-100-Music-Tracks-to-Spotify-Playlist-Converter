# Billboard-Top-100-Music-Tracks-to-Spotify-Playlist-Converter
This Python-based project takes a date as an input and searches Billboard.com for the top 100 music tracks on that day. The program then creates a Spotify playlist with the name of the input date and adds the top 100 tracks to the playlist.
